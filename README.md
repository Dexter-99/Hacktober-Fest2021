HacktoberFest Rules :

    To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone).
    Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/project. Look for the hacktoberfest topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest.
    Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count.
    If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
    This year, the first 55,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
